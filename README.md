An app that I would like to build is a fitness tracker. There was a site that I used
to help keep track of my lifts. It included a workout planner where you can add exercises, and
for each exercise, you can add the set and rep schemes along with the prescribed weight. There were also
this feature that used the data to create a graph where you can analyze your progression throughout the weeks
and months. Unfortunately, that organization didn't have an app, which would have been more convenient. 

## Notes

It took a bit of time to find some of the tools in Xcode, but otherwise, there were no challenges.
